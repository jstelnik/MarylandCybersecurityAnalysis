# Cybersecurity Awareness among Maryland Residents: Insights from a 2022 Survey
### Description
In late 2022, The Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute conducted a survey to gain insights into the cybersecurity awareness and practices of Maryland residents. The survey was conducted among a sample of over 500 residents across all counties in Maryland, using Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk as the means of garnering survey takers. The survey asked respondents about their knowledge of common cyber threats and prevention methods, their perception of the risks of cyber threats, and the steps they take to protect themselves from these threats. The results of the survey provide valuable insights into the current state of cybersecurity practices and awareness among Maryland residents and can help inform future efforts to improve online safety and security in the state.
